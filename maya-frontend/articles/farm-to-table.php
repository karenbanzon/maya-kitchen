<p>On September 28, Saturday, 9am&ndash;1pm, Chef Robby Goco, the man behind the Cyma Greek Taverna restaurant chain will again launch a new dining concept as he visits The Maya Kitchen for a cooking demonstration.
 
Chef Robby will share dishes inspired by Green Pastures, his latest restaurant that features a unique farm to table cuisine featuring dishes that are created from all organic, local, original, with no antibiotics, vine ripened, unprocessed whole ingredients.
           
The philosophy behind Green Pastures is to have the taste of the food as the main focus. It is to offer food the way it is supposed to be.
 
The food is not your usual bland, lackluster organic kitchen offerings but rather food of exceptional taste presented in the most creative ways. It is like gourmet organic with the restaurant offering duck, roast beef, chicken cooked slow for as long as six hours.
       
The chef uses lardon and has rillette on his menu. He pulls his own cheese and what he cannot produce on his own, he sources from reliable suppliers.
 
Chef Robby is a graduate of the California Culinary Academy. He owns and operates a total of eight Cyma Greek Taverna restaurants in Greenbelt 2, Shangri–la Plaza Mall, Trinoma, Eastwood Mall, Robinsons Place Ermita, Robinsons Magnolia, Ayala Mall Cebu and D’Mall Boracay. His latest venture, Green Pastures is on Level 4, East Wing, Shangri&ndash;la Plaza Mall.</p>
