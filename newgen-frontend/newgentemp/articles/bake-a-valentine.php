                    <p class="articleContent">Make this Valentine stand out with baked gifts you made yourself. Better still , get the family together to celebrate the day for a fun, educational time .

Baking has become a new found interest for many who have discovered loads of pleasures.Nothing can get the family more excited than food, that goes beyond the eating. It&rsquo;s the togetherness that matter: quiet time to catch up, listen , discover new interests, and create memories.

Baking engages the family with every step &mdash; from selecting the recipes, reading and explaining  the procedure , rounding up  utensils and ingredients, and the actual baking. Immerse the family in the science, art, fun, and flavors of baking . Throw in the banter, the laughter, and togetherness that form an essential part of the recipe.

Baking is always done out of love. What a delicious experience from start to finish ! And when the goodies are ready, not surprisingly, a bunch is always set aside for  a boyfriend, classmate, a friend, or officemates , which never fails to cheer. Because part of the joy is in the giving. And it never fails to touch a soft spot.

There&rsquo;s really a lot of love that goes into baking. So love and bake... and not just on Valentine&rsquo;s Day !!!</p>
